libpac

A library written in ANSI C to decode SBStudio PAC music modules into
a stream of integer PCM audio data.  SBStudio is a tracker for MS-DOS
written by Henning Hellstroem in the early 1990s.

This package contain the source code for the libpac library and two
plugins; one for XMMS (the X MultiMedia System) and one for Winamp
(consider this one a quick hack).  There's also a command-line player
included.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.
