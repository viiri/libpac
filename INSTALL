To build libpac, enter the src directory and type `make'.  To build
the texinfo documentation or the plugins, enter their respective
source directory and type `make'.

Windows users will have to use the MinGW environment.  I've only
tested the plugin on Windows XP using Winamp 5.2.  It may or may not
work with other versions.
